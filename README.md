# üìù Collaborative To-Do List Application

## Overview
Create a command-line or GUI-based to-do list that supports multiple users. Each user can add, remove, or mark tasks as complete, and the application should allow tasks to be categorized and assigned to users.

---

## Core Requirements

1. **Data storage** for tasks and user-specific views of tasks.

2. **Task categorization and status tracking** (e.g., completed, pending).

3. **Support for concurrency**, so multiple users can access and edit tasks concurrently.

---

## Language-Specific Feature Examples

### Java
- Use **classes** for users and tasks
- Demonstrate **object-oriented principles**
- Implement concurrency using **threads**

### JavaScript
- Use **asynchronous operations** (like Promises or async/await) to simulate concurrent access
- Employ **JSON** for data storage
